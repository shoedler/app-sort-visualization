## Usage

- Run `npm ci`
- Run `npm run start`

## Roadmap

- [ ] Fix redrawing issues of the Page. Sometimes array bars are not displayed (in the wrong spot) or bars are colored wrongly / keep the color from the array operations
- [ ] Check all `TODO (classification)` Comments - some situations in the sorting algos probably need additional functionality in `observableArray`. This is just to make sure the displayed "stats" are correct.
